# ðŸ“– Alice Task Manager

Alice is a personal task management assistant with both **CLI** and **GUI** support.  
You can add tasks, mark them as done, delete them, and even set deadlines and events.  
All your tasks are saved automatically into a file (`duke.txt`) so you donâ€™t lose progress between sessions.
