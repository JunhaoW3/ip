AI Model used: ChatGPT

1. Increment: AiAssisted
- For this increment, I used AI to improve the quality of my code as well as to make it more compliant to OOP principles
- Interesting observations: I was able to quickly generate code with decent OOP, but there are certain instances when the code generated does not have the same text display as I wanted

2. Increment: BetterGui
- For this increment, I used AI to improve the GUI of the alice code
- Interesting observations: Sometimes, they write the code wrongly and omit certain variables as they are unaware of the full codebase. Therefore, they do not know how each function is supposed to work. For the AI to work better, perhaps it would be a good idea to copy and paste your whole project into the prompt
